The project is about text classification using CNN Model.
First we load the data set using the pandas dataframe.
pre process the data and convert it into execting form.
the we create a model based on Convolusion neural networks.
It fully demonstrates how to use the number of layers their weights and biases, epochs and other parameters to find the required output.
The model gave good accuracy and we can further change the parameters according to the problems needs.
